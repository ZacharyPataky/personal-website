            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Greetings! My name is <span>Zachary Pataky</span>, and I'll be the host of your current Spacebnb.</p>
            <p>
                I'm just your average twenty-something-year-old who spends too much time staring at computer
                screens. I started my programming journey at <span>Canisius College</span>, where I earned a
                <span>BS in Computer Science</span>. I spent four long, grueling, Zoom-ridden years honing my skills
                through projects covering <span>distributed computing</span>, <span>artificial intelligence</span>,
                <span>video game development</span>, <span>web development</span>, and so much more. I was an
                excellent student, tutor, teacher's assistant, and, most-importantly, member of my campus community.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nowadays, I spend most of my development time spread between my job and personal studies. I currently
                work at <span>CYBRA Corporation</span> as a <span>Junior Software Engineer</span>. By all means, I'm
                a <span>full-stack developer</span> with a preference for front-end design and execution. Outside of
                work, I dedicate decent chucks of time to my <span>Udemy coursework</span> and other personal
                projects. I'm a <span>forever student</span> with a <span>growth mindset</span>, and <span>I will do
                    whatever I can to become the best software developer I can be.</span>
