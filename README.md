# personal-website
Welcome to my personal website.  Feel free to scroll around, perusing a digital rendition of my professional resume.  Learn about me as a person, my educational experience, my work experience, and more.  Please send me an email via the contact page - I'd love to learn more about my visitors.

I wrote this website using raw HTML, CSS, and JS.  I initially considered writing it in Angular; however, I thought the tools were too big and sophisticated for what is ultimately such a small project.  The only external resources I use are photos (courtesy of Unsplash.com) and Netlify; I use the latter for hosting and its form-detection capabilitiesâ€”whatever you write in the _Contact Me_ section will be sent to my personal email address.

It took me a while and a few design overhauls, but I'm very happy to see how this site turned out. I can't wait to seriously revisit it in a few years after I further hone my web development expertise.
