Welcome to my personal website.  Feel free to scroll around, perusing a digital rendition of my professional resume.  Learn about me as a person, my educational experience, my work experience, and more.  Please send me an email via the contact page - I'd love to learn more about my visitors.

I wrote this website using raw HTML, CSS, and JS.  I initially considered writing it in Angular; however, I initially thought the tools were too big and sophisticated for what is ultimately such a small project.  The only external resources I use are photos (courtesy of Unsplash.com) and Formspree; I use the latter for the "Contact Me" section since GitHub Pages doesn't allow for proper backend languages like PHP.  

It took me a while and a few design overhauls, but I'm very happy to see how this site turned out. I can't wait to seriously revisit it in a few years after I further hone my web development expertise.
