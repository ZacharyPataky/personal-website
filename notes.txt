Consider trimming some of the styles
    I can see some of the section headers getting redundant
    Same with the placeholder photo
Maybe make sections space-between instead of space-evenly
Make the course highlights direct users to the Canisius Catalog
Add a few photo/quote bars or something to make the page interesting
    Especially to not make education/work-exp too repetitive with the tabs
    Hell, maybe even flip Work-Exp's sides so the header and tabs are on the right
